Throwing shade on GRBs with galaxies.

## First

This tool uses [popsynth](https://cosmogrb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to read the [catalog](https://www.sao.ru/lv/lvgdb/introduction.php) of Local Volume galaxies:




## Second

Then create a a population of GRBs from a given redshift and luminosity distribution and sees how many of these GRBs overlap with the Local Volume galaxies by chance:

## Third

The population of GRBs is run through [cosmogrb](https://cosmogrb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see what their detected properties are.
